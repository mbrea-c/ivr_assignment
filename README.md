# ivr_assignment
The assignment for Introduction to Vision and Robotics.
In this assignment we use ROS and apply our knowledge acquired during the course to find the joint angles of a robot in 3D with the help of information from two cameras
and to find the target (vision.py).
Then we control the robot so that it moves its end-effector to our desired position with the help of Kinematics (control.py).
